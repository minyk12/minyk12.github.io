summary: “Why I chose MIS.”
I chose to pursue a degree in MIS because I wanted to challenge myself. Although I have no knowledge or experience, I’ve always been interested in it, and after taking BUS-311 last semester, I couldn’t resist. As I continue my academic journey, I look forward to building a strong foundation that will successfully get me to where I want to be in my professional career.</li>
