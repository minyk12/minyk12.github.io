I chose to pursue a degree in MIS because I wanted to challenge myself. Although I have no knowledge or experience, I've always been interested in it, and after taking BUS-311 last semester, I couldn't resist. As I continue my academic journey, I look forward to building a strong foundation that will successfully get me to where I want to be in my professional career. 

Here is some code that illustrates how we read values from the line sensors:

```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
