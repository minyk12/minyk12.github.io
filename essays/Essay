Hi! My name is Miny, and I never thought I would do it, but I chose to pursue a degree in MIS because I wanted to really challenge myself (I don't regret it yet). I've always been interested but never thought I was smart enough to do it, but I knew I'd regret it if I didn't go for it. I know I'll make a lot of mistakes at first, but I look forward to learning from them and continuing to grow as I expand my knowledge and skills.
