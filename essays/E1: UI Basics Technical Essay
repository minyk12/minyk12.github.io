   WOD1 
Going into the WODs, I was pretty nervous just because I wasn't sure what to expect. I ran into issues with my Screencast, so it took me some time to figure out another screen recording platform to use, but I figured it out. I'm embarassed to say how long it took, but the first WOD took me about 40 minutes to complete. I had to go back and forth multiple times to the instructions as well as the Screencasts, but I was able to push through and get it done!

WOD2
WOD 2 wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, especially after surviving the first WOD, but I did struggle a little bit here and there. It did take me almost 20 minutes to complete, and again, I had to go back and forth a few times, but after going over the readings, I had a better understanding and was able to pullt through. 

WOD3 
I don't know why, but WOD 3 was challenging and I struggled a lot to the point where I just couldn't figure it out, and it took me almost 25 minutes. I was able to successfully place the Brief History of IE over to the left-side column, but I couldn't figure out how to place the other two browsers. 

Final Thoughts 
For someone who has no knowledge on any of this kind of stuff, it was very challening but rewarding in the end whenever I was able to see everything live. I almost couldn't stop when I couldn't get passed something and didn't realize how long it had taken me to complete each WOD. I definitely need to go back on the readings and lectures and continue to practice, practice, practice!
